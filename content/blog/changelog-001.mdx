## 3. Postman Compatibility
Firecamp 3.0 brings full compatibility with Postman, ensuring a smooth transition for users familiar with PM's environment variables, global variables, collection variables, and scripts. We have worked diligently to align Firecamp's scripting capabilities with PM's scripting paradigm, allowing users to leverage their existing knowledge and scripts effortlessly.

3.1. Environment Variables
3.2. Globals
3.3. Collection Variables
3.4. Scripts (Pre-request and Tests):

### 3.1 Environment Variables:
Introducing Environment Variables, Firecamp 3.0 allows you to define and utilize variables throughout your workspace. The Environment variables allow you to create sets of variables specific to a particular environment. This flexibility empowers you to streamline your workflow and maintain consistency across your requests.

### 3.2 Globals:
With Firecamp 3.0, you can define Global variables within your workspace. These variables can be accessed and reused in any request or collection within the same workspace, enabling you to centralize commonly used values and configurations. By utilizing globals, you can efficiently manage and update shared variables across the workspace scope.

### 3.3 Collection Variables:
In addition, Firecamp 3.0 supports collection variables. Collection variables are specific to a particular collection and can be used across multiple requests within that collection. This feature enables you to organize and maintain variables at the collection level, further enhancing the modularity and reusability of your requests.

### 3.4 Scripts (Pre-request and Tests):
Firecamp 3.0 introduces enhanced scripting capabilities that are the most compatible with Postman's scripts. You can now write pre-request scripts and tests using the familiar PM's scripting syntax within Firecamp. This compatibility ensures a seamless transition for users accustomed to writing scripts in Postman, allowing them to leverage their existing knowledge and effortlessly migrate their scripts to Firecamp. However, we're improving this feature based on community feedback. You can share your feedback on GitHub.

## 4. Breaking changes
### Cross-app collaboration
We have re-architectured the Firecamp to be a web-first and truly multi-protocol platform. To enhance team collaboration, the desktop version (v2) is no longer compatible. We encourage teams currently on v2 to transition to Firecamp v3 for a smoother collaborative experience. Don't worry, your data remains unaffected. Need help to move? Reach out to us on Discord. Upgrade to Firecamp v3 and enjoy seamless collaboration!


### Environment
- Collection-level and Workspace-level environments are no longer supported
Previously created environments will be shown in your account, and you can clone them instantly into environment variables
    - step-1 click on the environment Icon to open the sidebar, 
    - step-2 at the bottom of the sidebar, you'll have your old environments. you can clone from there.

### Scripts
The Firecamp v2 scripts are no longer supported, New Firecamp scripts are now most compatible with Postman Scripts. We understand the importance of maintaining compatibility and reducing friction when transitioning between tools. By aligning Firecamp with Postman's scripting capabilities, we aim to provide a familiar and seamless experience for both existing Postman users and new users looking to benefit from Firecamp's multi-protocol capabilities.
