# Privacy Policy 

Your privacy is critically important to us. At Firecamp, we have a few fundamental principles:

* We try to collect as little personal information as possible.
* We aim for full transparency on how we gather, use, and share your personal information.
* We are thoughtful about the personal information we ask you to provide and the personal information that we collect about you through the operation of our services.
* We store personal information for only as long as we have a reason to keep it.
Below is our Privacy Policy, which incorporates and clarifies these principles.
<br/>

### 1. Who We Are and What This Policy Covers​

This Privacy Policy applies to information that we collect about you when you use:
* Our websites;
* Our applications (for example the Firecamp app);
* Our other products, services, and features that are available on or through our websites/application.<br/>
Throughout this Privacy Policy we’ll refer to our websites, applications, and other products and services collectively as “Services.”
This Privacy Policy is based on the [Automattic Privacy Policy](https://automattic.com/privacy/) and available under a [Creative Commons Sharealike license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/). You’re more than welcome to copy it, adapt it, and repurpose it for your own use. Just make sure to revise the language so that your policy reflects your actual practices. If you do use it, we’d appreciate a credit and link to us somewhere on your site.
<br/>

### 2. Information We Collect​

We only collect information about you if we have a reason to do so — for example, to provide our Services, to communicate with you, or to make our Services better.
We collect this information from three sources: if and when you provide information to us, automatically through operating our Services, and from outside sources. Let’s go over the information that we collect.
<br/>

#### **2.1 Information You Provide to Us​**

It’s probably no surprise that we collect information that you provide to us directly. Here are some examples:
- Basic account information: We ask for basic information from you in order to set up your account. For example, we require individuals who sign up for a Firecamp account to provide an email address and password (if no third-party login is used), along with a username or name — and that’s it.
- Business Profile: Some of our products collect additional information from you as part of creating a user/customer profile. we use the information you provide us like your timezone and location information, your company and team information, and your contact information, to set up your account and power the Service’s features.
- Communications with us: You may also provide us with information when you respond to surveys, communicate with us about a support question or post a question in our public forums. When you communicate with us via email, public forum comments, or otherwise, we may store a copy of our communications.

<br/>

**2.2 Use of Permissions for a chrome-extension**

Firecamp chrome-extension needs a couple of permissions from users to enable certain features in Firecamp.These all necessary permissions are listed below

- **activeTab** : to set app icon, badges and it's text colors.
- **allHost** : to allow users to test their end-points in APIs/WS/GraphQL like testing GUI clients.
- **identity** : to let you sign-in/sign-up via Google directly from the extension.
- **storage** : to save offline data locally

<br/>

**2.3 Information We Collect Automatically**

We also collect some information automatically:

* Log information: Like most online service providers, we collect information that web browsers typically make available, including the browser type, language preference, the date and time of access. We collect log information when you use our Services — for example when you create or make changes to your Firecamp account.
* Transactional information: When you make a purchase through our Services, we collect information about the transaction, such as product details, purchase price, and the date and location of the transaction.
* Telemetry data: We collect anonymized telemetry data in our Firecamp app. For more details, read our [telemetry documentation](https://firecamp.io/docs/telemetry/).

<br/>

**2.4 Information We Collect from Other Sources​** 

We may also get information about you from other sources. For example:
- Third Party Login: If you create or log in to your Firecamp account through another service (like GitHub) we’ll receive associated login information (e.g. a connection-token, your username, your email address)
The information we receive depends on which services you use or authorize and what options are available.

<br/>

### 3.How and Why We Use Information​

**3.1 Purposes for Using Information​** 

We use information about you for the purposes listed below:
- To provide our Services. For example, to set up and maintain your account, provide customer service, process payments and orders, and verify user information.
- To ensure quality, maintain safety, and improve our Services. For example, by providing automatic upgrades and new versions of our Services. Or, for example, by monitoring and analyzing how users interact with our Services so we can create new features that we think our users will enjoy and that will help them create and manage websites more efficiently or make our Services easier to use.
- To protect our Services, our users, and the public. For example, by detecting security incidents; detecting and protecting against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity; fighting spam; complying with our legal obligations; and protecting the rights and property of Firecamp and others, which may result in us, for example, declining a transaction or terminating Services.
- To fix problems with our Services. For example, by monitoring, debugging, repairing, and preventing issues.
- To communicate with you. For example, by emailing you to ask for your feedback, share tips for getting the most out of our products, or keep you up to date on Firecamp ; texting you to verify your payment; or calling you to share offers and promotions that we think will be of interest to you. If you don’t want to hear from us, you can opt out of marketing communications at any time. (If you opt out, we’ll still send you important updates relating to your account.)

<br/>

### 4. What information we do not collect

<br/>


### 5. Sharing Information​

**5.1 Disclosure to third parties​**

We share specific information with third parties, which are listed here.
- Github 
- google 
- MongoDB Atlas 
- Amazon Web Services 
- Sendgrid 
- Google analytics 

As for infrastructure services such as Google Cloud or Cloudflare, we do not voluntarily share information about you with them. Rather, they receive information about you when you access their services (which is the case because we rely on these infrastructure services).
<br/>
**5.2 How We Share Information​**

We share information about you in limited circumstances, and with appropriate safeguards on your privacy.

- **Third-party vendors**: We may share information about you with third-party vendors who need the information in order to provide their services to us, or to provide their services to you or your site. This includes vendors that help us provide our Services to you (like Paddle, our payment provider, cloud storage services, email delivery services that help us stay in touch with you, customer chat and email support services that help us communicate with you); those that help us understand and enhance our Services (like Mixpanel, our analytics provider); those that make tools to help us run our operations (like programs that help us with task management, scheduling, word processing, email and other communications, and collaboration among our teams) and other third-party tools that help us manage operations.
<br/>

**5.3 Third-Party Apps**

You, your administrator or other Service users may choose to add new functionality or change the behavior of the Services by enabling integrations with third-party apps within the Services. Doing so may give third-party apps access to your account and information about you like your name and email address, and any content you choose to use in connection with those apps. If you are an administrator on an account, you may permit us to share your details with the third-party app provider upon installation. Third-party app policies and procedures are not controlled by us, and this privacy policy does not cover how third-party apps use your information. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of third parties before connecting to or using their applications or services to learn more about their privacy and information-handling practices. If you object to information about you being shared with these third parties, please uninstall the app or delete the third-party app integration, as applicable, and discontinue the use of the third-party app.
<br/>

**5.4 Links to Third Party Sites**

The Services may include links that direct you to other websites or services whose privacy practices may differ from ours. If you submit information to any of those third party sites, your information is governed by their privacy policies, not this one. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policy of any website you visit.
- Legal and regulatory requirements: We may disclose information about you in response to a subpoena, court order, or another governmental request.
- To protect rights, property, and others: We may disclose information about you when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Firecamp , third parties, or the public at large. For example, if we have a good faith belief that there is an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury, we may disclose information related to the emergency without delay.
- Business transfers: In connection with any merger, sale of company assets, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company, or in the event that riok goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would likely be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. If any of these events were to happen, this Privacy Policy would continue to apply to your information and the party receiving your information may continue to use your information, but only consistent with this Privacy Policy.
- With your consent: We may share and disclose information with your consent or at your direction. For example, we may share your information with third parties when you authorize us to do so.
- Aggregated or de-identified information: We may share information that has been aggregated or de-identified so that it can no longer reasonably be used to identify you. For instance, we may publish aggregate statistics about the use of our Services.
- Published support requests: If you send us a request for assistance (for example, via a GitHub, email or one of our other feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish that request to clarify or respond to your request, or to help us support other users.

We have a policy that we do not and will never sell our users’ data. We aren’t a data broker, we don’t sell your personal information to data brokers, and we don’t sell your information to other companies that want to spam you with marketing emails.
<br/>
**5.5 Other important information:**
 
- **Team and workspace:**  You’ve become a part of any workspace or joined the team through the invitation which means your admin has a right to access your account information. 
Please note that you can ask for any further information from your team’s owner. We’ll only access data if there is any security concern for that particular team with their consent only. 

<br/>
**5.3 How Long We Keep Information​**

We generally discard information about you when it’s no longer needed for the purposes for which we collect and use it — described in the section above on How and Why We Use Information — and we’re not legally required to keep it.

<br/>

### 6. How to access and control your information

- **Access and update your information:** You can update certain information about your account from the application directly. 

- **Deleting your account and information:**  You’ve all rights to delete your information by yourself from the application itself. You can learn more from the documentation. 

- **Requesting us to stop using your account:**  In some cases, you request us to stop using your account and information but when your account is associated with organizations (that you part of in past) then it’s their privacy policy on how long they use information. 
But if the account is only created with your permission, we will stop using your information with your consent. This may take some time to investigate and facilitate the request. If your information is shared with third parties, please disable the integration to remove the access.  
<br/>

### 7. Security​

While no online service is 100% secure, we work very hard to protect information about you against unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction, and take reasonable measures to do so. We monitor our Services for potential vulnerabilities and attacks.
